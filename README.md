### Compatibility

Compatible with MRI Ruby 3.2+, and concordant releases of JRuby, and TruffleRuby.
CI workflows and Appraisals are generated for MRI Ruby 3.2+.
This test floor is configured by `ruby.test_minimum` in `.kettle-jem.yml` and
may be higher than the gem's runtime compatibility floor when legacy Rubies are
not practical for the current toolchain.

The _amazing_ test matrix is powered by the kettle-dev stack.

## ✨ Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```console
bundle add rubocop-lts
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```console
gem install rubocop-lts
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

## 🔧 Basic Usage

## 🦷 FLOSS Funding

While rubocop-lts tools are free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding.
Raising a monthly budget of... "dollars" would make the project more sustainable.

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors! We also offer a
wide array of funding channels to account for your preferences.
Currently, [Open Collective][🖇osc] is our preferred funding platform.

**If you're working in a company that's making significant use of rubocop-lts tools we'd
appreciate it if you suggest to your company to become a rubocop-lts sponsor.**

You can support the development of rubocop-lts tools via
[GitHub Sponsors][🖇sponsor],
[Liberapay][⛳liberapay],
[PayPal][🖇paypal],
[Open Collective][🖇osc]
and [Tidelift][🏙️entsup-tidelift].

| 📍 NOTE |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If doing a sponsorship in the form of donation is problematic for your company <br/> from an accounting standpoint, we'd recommend the use of Tidelift, <br/> where you can get a support-like subscription instead. |

### Open Collective for Individuals

### Another way to support open-source

I’m driven by a passion to foster a thriving open-source community – a space where people can tackle complex problems, no matter how small. Revitalizing libraries that have fallen into disrepair, and building new libraries focused on solving real-world challenges, are my passions. I was recently affected by layoffs, and the tech jobs market is unwelcoming. I’m reaching out here because your support would significantly aid my efforts to provide for my family, and my farm (11 🐔 chickens, 2 🐶 dogs, 3 🐰 rabbits, 8 🐈‍ cats).

If you work at a company that uses my work, please encourage them to support me as a corporate sponsor. My work on gems you use might show up in `bundle fund`.

I’m developing a new library, [floss_funding][🖇floss-funding-gem], designed to empower open-source developers like myself to get paid for the work we do, in a sustainable way. Please give it a look.

## 📌 Versioning

This library follows [![Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver-img]][📌semver] for its public API where practical.
For most applications, prefer the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("rubocop-lts", "~> 14.0")
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary>📌 Is "Platform Support" part of the public API? More details inside.</summary>

Dropping support for a platform can be a breaking change for affected users.
If a release changes supported platforms, it should be called out clearly in the changelog and versioned with that impact in mind.

To get a better understanding of how SemVer is intended to work over a project's lifetime,
read this article from the creator of SemVer:

## 🤑 A request for help

Maintainers have teeth and need to pay their dentists.
After getting laid off in an RIF in March, and encountering difficulty finding a new one,
I began spending most of my time building open source tools.
I'm hoping to be able to pay for my kids' health insurance this month,
so if you value the work I am doing, I need your support.
Please consider sponsoring me or the project.
