## Release

To release a new version:

1. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` as a tests, coverage, & linting sanity check.
2. update the version number in `version.rb`
3. run `bundle exec rake build:checksum`
4. move the built gem to project root
5. run `bin/checksum` to create the missing SHA256 checksum
6. move the built gem back to `pkg/`
7. commit the changes
8. run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org][rubygems].

NOTE: You will need to have a public key in `certs/`, and list your cert in the
`gemspec`, in order to sign the new release.
